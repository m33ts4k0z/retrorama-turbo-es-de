# Retrorama Turbo for ES-DE

This is a port of the beautiful retro theme by [lipebello](https://github.com/lipebello/es-theme-retrorama-turbo), originally made for the Retropie and then ported to Launchbox.

It works with the latest theme engine (as of the time of writing this) of EmulationStation Desktop Edition: v2.2.1

I have yet to test the 16:10 ratio but I will since I plan on using this on my Legion Go. For the moment, the settings are the same for both 16:9 and 16:10

This port is absolutely not perfect but works for my needs and I will try to update it if I notice any bugs.
